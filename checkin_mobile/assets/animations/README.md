# Animation Assets

Place Lottie JSON animation files in this directory:

- `success.json` - Success checkmark animation
- `error.json` - Error/failure animation  

Recommended sources for free Lottie animations:
- https://lottiefiles.com

Look for:
- "checkmark" or "success" animations
- "error" or "warning" animations

Keep files optimized (<50KB) for fast loading.
